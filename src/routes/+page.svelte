		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p class="overview">PI Link is a digital reimplementation of the board game <em>Detective Club</em> published in 2018.  In each round, one of the players &mdash; the Informant &mdash; secretly teams up with another &mdash; the Conspirator &mdash; and tries to make them guess a secret word using two illustrated cards.  Other players are Detectives, who also know the word, but don&rsquo;t know the identities of each other.  Detectives have to find out who the Conspirator is, making sure they don&rsquo;t get accused by their fellow players!</p>
		<p class="overview">PI Link can be used as a companion app to the original game or can be played as a stand-alone game.  Each player just needs a mobile device and 25 unique illustrated cards, such as those provided in other popular board games like <em>Dixit</em> and <em>Mysterium</em>.  To get started, simply create an account at the <a data-testid="register-inline" class="href-inline" href="/register">Register</a> page, then login at the <a data-testid="login-inline" class="href-inline" href="/login">Login</a> page.  The app provides context-specific tips along the way to teach you the game.  If you wish to review the official rules for Detective Club, you can download them <a class="href-inline" href="https://cdn.1j1ju.com/medias/92/14/39-detective-club-rulebook.pdf">here</a>.</p>
